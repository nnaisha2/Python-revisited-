# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains small Python projects I completed while working through *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart. Each project is from the exercises at the end of the chapters.

## Completed Projects

### 1. Word Scramble Game âœ¨
A simple word scramble game where the player tries to guess the original word from a scrambled version.

- The game fetches a random word and scrambles it.
- The player has 2 attempts to guess the correct word.
- After 2 incorrect guesses, the correct word is revealed.
- The player can choose to play again or exit.

#### How to Play:
Run the script, and it will display a scrambled word. Type your guess and press Enter. If correct, you win! Otherwise, you have another chance before losing.

### 2. Collatz Sequence
A script that takes an integer input and prints the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1.

- If the number is even, it is divided by 2.
- If the number is odd, it is transformed using `3n + 1`.
- The sequence continues until the number becomes 1.

#### How to Run:
Execute the script and input any positive integer to see its Collatz sequence.

I plan to complete all exercises from the book and add them here. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
